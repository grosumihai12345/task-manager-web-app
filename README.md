# task-manager-web-app
As a user, I should be able to:
Add a task
A task should be added through the completion of a form.
The form should be opened by clicking on a button that opens a dialog (use the HTML dialog element!!)
Added tasks should be stored in localStorage
The task form should contain fields for a title, description and assignee.
The title should only contain alphanumeric characters and shouldnâ€™t be longer than 50 chars. Use a standard input.
The description should have a maximum of 250 chars, use a textarea.
Use an email field for the assignee.
Mark a task as completed.
Delete a task.
View tasks (separate the completed tasks from those still in progress)
